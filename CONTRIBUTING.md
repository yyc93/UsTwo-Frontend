# Contributing

In general feel free to open issues / pull requests if you spot something â€“ though we don't expect anyone outside of ustwo to do free work for us :)

If you're still serious about contributing, please have a read of our guidelines below.

## General

Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) in your editor of choice, whitespace flipping is naughty!

## JavaScript

There's too much to list here, but in general we mostly agree with the [Airbnb ES6 style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and [Khan Academy React style guide](https://github.com/Khan/style-guides/blob/master/style/react.md).

TODO: Should we enforce with [JSCS](http://jscs.info/) (see [Airbnb's settings](https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs/blob/master/presets/airbnb.json))?

## CSS

**"Write CSS, not SASS (well... unless absolutely necessary)"**

Some suggestions and guidelines that will make the styling codebase simple, readable, consistent and relatively transferable to other CSS processor languages.

Approach writing the code with a 'vanilla CSS' ethos, only adding non-standard syntax (SASS or perhaps PostCSS) when absolutely necessary.

#### Comments

With this approach in mind use CSS comments `/* ... */` and not SASS `//`.

Each CSS file should have the following at the top:

```css
/*
 *  COMPONENT NAME
 *  Short description of the component
 *
 *  Notes: Anything unusual or complicated to mention
 *  TODO:
 */
```

#### Attribute order

We feel there is a familiar and natural order of how to write an element's attributes when we consider a) how a node is drawn and painted in the browser and b) the thought process when writing the element's styles.

- **content, box-sizing, clear, overflow** - Unusual/breaking rules, flags, resets, everything else (?)
- **position, top, right, bottom, left**  - Position is a naughty (but helpful) rule, can remove element from the flow
- **display, flex properties, float**  - How the element behaves in the flow
- **width, height, margin, padding** - Box Model, dimensions etc
- **border, border-radius, background** - Cosmetics of the box
- **color, font, line-height, text** - Text and innards behaviour
- **transform, opacity, visibility** - Modify the element
- **transition, animation** - Motion

#### Media queries

Write media queries at the bottom of the component file, each one inside of the main selector name so as to be in scope of the component for component specific variables.

```scss
.component-name {
  /*...*/

  @media screen and (min-width: $breakpoint) {
    /*...*/
  }
}
```

#### Selector naming conventions

Simple words separated by hyphens as a preference to camelCasing or underscores.

### SASS

Three very useful, arguably unavoidable CSS extensions:

#### Import

Simply import all scss partials into the main file `@import "path-to-component-name"`

#### Nesting

Try to avoid anything more than a selector nested within an already nested selector (three selectors deep).

```scss
.component-name {
  padding: 20px;

  .element {
    font-size: 16px;

    span {
      font-weight: bold;
    }
  }
}
```

#### SASS Variables

All variables used within a component should be scoped inside the main selector (thus simple naming conventions can be used). For global variables, define them inside the global variables file.

```scss
/* _variables.scss */
$header-height: 70px;

/* _component-name.scss */
.component-name {
  $height: $header-height;
  $gutter: 20px;

  height: $height;

  .element {
    padding: 0 $gutter;
  }
}
```

Move to PostCSS's custom-properties and `var()`?

### Advanced SASS

#### Mixins and Extends

Try to use mixins only if an argument is being passed in, limit the amount of unchanging code (can that code be used as an extend instead?). Include the mixin or extend at the top of the attribute stack with space underneath before the first attribute.

```scss
/* mixins.scss */
@mixin mixin-name(argument) {
  color: argument;
}

/* component */
.component {
  @include mixin-name(red);

  width: 50%;
  border: 1px solid;
}
```

#### Loops, functions etc

If you really need them, then go bananas ![image](http://www.sherv.net/cm/emo/funny/2/banana.gif) but extensively document.

## SVG vector graphics and animations

We're keeping our vector icons in an external [SVG spritemap](./src/app/images/spritemap.svg), loaded using the `use xlink:href` method. There's a React component named (surprisingly) `SVG` to cleanly link and include these. For a step by step guide to optimising the svg code and using the sprites, follow the instructions in [ASSETS.md](./docs/ASSETS.md).

To make these work on IE we're using [SVG4everybody](https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody).

Also, for animation sequences (like the down chevron or the close `x`), we're using SVG sequences with a bespoke component called `SVGSequenceAnimation`. Unfortunately right now it's not possible to manipulate external SVGs, so these need to be inlined.

The component `loading-icon` has a relatively large and complex css animation. Therefore a stylus plugin called Ornithopter has been used to generate these keyframes thus making maintenance easier. Please see the [README.md](./src/app/lib/spinner-keyframe-generator/README.md) for this library if any changes need to be made.
